Hey, Shaan here!
As we all know that tailwind CSS is gaining popularity nowadays, so I decided to give a shot and learn tailwind css. After learning a little bit and creating a landing page with tailwind, I found it awesome and decided to use tailwind for my future React projects. But hey! configuring Tailwind with React is not an easy task. So, I thought why not create a template repository so that beginner ReactJS developers can use to quickly configure their projects. In this article, I will show exactly how to configure your ReactJS + tailwind css project & also how to create a template repository which you can use.

# Creating a react app

Start by creating a new react app if you haven't already by typing using create-react-app.

<CodeHeader />
```bash
npx create-react-app cra-tailwind-template
cd cra-tailwind-template
```

# Setting up Tailwind CSS

Install Tailwind CSS by typing -

<CodeHeader />
```bash
npm install tailwindcss@npm:@tailwindcss/postcss7-compat @tailwindcss/postcss7-compat postcss@^7 autoprefixer@^9
```

### Configure Craco

Install and configure craco by typing -

<CodeHeader />
```bash
npm install @craco/craco
```

Once it is installed, edit your 'scripts' section of your **package.json** file.

<CodeHeader />
```json
"scripts": {
    "start": "craco start",
    "build": "craco build",
    "test": "craco test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  },
```

Next, we need to create a craco.config.js file at the root of your project and add the **tailwindcss** and **autoprefixer** as PostCSS Plugins.

<CodeHeader />
```javascript
module.exports = {
  style: {
    postcss: {
      plugins: [require("tailwindcss"), require("autoprefixer")],
    },
  },
};
```

### Creating configuration file

Next, we have to generate our **tailwind.config.js** file like this -

<CodeHeader />
```bash 
npx tailwind init 
```

This will create a **tailwind.config.js** file at the root of your project.

### Edit tailwind.config.js file

Next, we have to edit our tailwind.config.js file. Configure 'purge' option with the paths of your components so that any unused styles in the production builds.

<CodeHeader />
```javascript
module.exports = {
  purge: ["./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}", "./public/index.html"],
  darkMode: false,
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

### Include Tailwind in your CSS

Open **src/index.css** and include the following by using the @tailwind directive.

<CodeHeader />
```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Finally include your **index.css** in your **src/index.css** file.

<CodeHeader />
```javascript
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import "./index.css"; // include index.css
import App from "./App";
import reportWebVitals from "./reportWebVitals";

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

And that's it. This is how we configure ReactJS with Tailwind CSS.

# Final Part - Creating a template repo for later use

In this section, I'll show you how to create a template repo which you can use in future so that you won't have to setup from the scratch.

### Initialize a git repository.

Type the following command to create an empty git repo.

<CodeHeader />
```bash
git init
```

### Commit changes

Add the files to the staging area, and the commit the changes.

<CodeHeader />
```bash
git add .
git commit -m 'initial commit'
```

### Moving code to GitHub.

Log into your GitHub account and create a new repo y click the **"+"** icon on the top right hand corner. Provide a name for your repo (for example - react-tailwind-template)
![Alt Text](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/we00d6cs1r4d4751qqj3.png)
![Alt Text](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/r2qpxo9tyoi7rrxyq9mk.png)
After giving name, you will see something like this.
![Alt Text](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/4ise4saflx7q4rizo0pn.png)
Now, type the following commands in your terminal

<CodeHeader />
```git
git remote add origin https://github.com/shaan71845/react-tailwind-template.git
git push -u origin main
```

You have successfully uploaded your code on GitHub!!

# Creating template

After following the above steps, you will be redirected to your repo. Click on the **Settings** tab and check the **Template repository** option.
