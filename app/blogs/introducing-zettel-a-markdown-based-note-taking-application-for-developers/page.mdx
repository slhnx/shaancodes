## What is Zettel? üòç

This is a good starting point to introduce Zettel. So, zettel is basically a german word for **A brief note** in english. It is a markdown based note-taking App which I created for myself where I could take notes easily and all the notes will be easily available to me. I hear you saying **‚ÄúBut you could have used Notion or obsidian, Why reinvent the wheel?‚Äù** I understand your question and it is a valid one. But, I wanted to create something of my own which I can use daily, and in the process I can also learn and elevate my development skills.

## Features ‚ú®
